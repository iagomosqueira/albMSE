Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 138  < max pop len bins: 140; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 17 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 1 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 18 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Warning 19 : Reminder: Number of lambdas !=0.0 and !=1.0:  18
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
