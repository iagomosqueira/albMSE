# Executive Summary

# Introduction

## Stock Overview

- Map distribution

## Commercial exploitation

## Scientific advice

- Catch limits or other management measures
- Compliance

## MSE Background

- Process
- Decisions
- Work carried out & presented

## Objectives

- Management objectives: overall IOTC MSY objective, other MPs
- Tuning objectives
- Secondary objectives

# Methods

## Simulation and Evaluation Framework

- ADD MSE simulation workflow

## Operating Models (OMs)

- DESCRIBE OM structure

- TABLE OMs tested

### Conditioning

- DESCRIBE input data

#### Operating model update

- New dataset for [@WPTmT_2025] assessment
  - Updated annual nominal catch series from 2010
- Differences in catch not large enough to affect productivcity estimates, thus no full re-conditioning
- **PLOT** Comparison SS3 runs

```{r data-sas-compare, fig.cap="Time series of annual recruitment, spawning stock biomass, catch and fishing mortality estimated by the 2022 and 2025 NW LLCPUE stock assessment model runs for Indian ocean albacore tuna."}
knitr::include_graphics("report/data_sas_compare.png")
```

- 2025 SS3 model not fully endorsed, problems.

- Conditioned OM updated to 2024 by
  - Projecting forward using the new catch series 2010:2024
  - Recruitment deviances from the conditioned OM used in 2022 assessment, on top of SRR with new SSB 2010-2020, and from future deviances (LM, sigmaR and rho by sample) 2021-2024
  - Proportions by quarter kept as in projection set up, no changes between the two datasets, constant in time (Fiigure \@ref(fig:data-sas-catchprops))

```{r data-sas-catchprops, fig.cap="Annual proportion by season of the total catch for Indian ocean albacore tuna, obtained from the inputs to both the 2022 and 2025 stock assessment model runs."}
knitr::include_graphics("report/data_sas_catchprops.png")

### Performance statistics

- *SB*, Spawner biomass.
- *SB/SB[0]*, Spawner biomass relative to unfished.
- *min(SB/SB[0])*, Minimum spawner biomass relative to unfished.
- *SB/SB[MSY]*, Spawnwer biomass relative to SBMSY.
- *R*, Recruitment.
- *HR*, Annual relative harvest rate, computed as an seasonal average of the sum of the harvest rates by fishery over the HR at MSY reference point, $\sum_{f=1}^{6} HR_{f} / HR_{MSY}$.
- *P(Green)*, Probability of being in Kobe green quadrant, $SB > SB_{MSY} \land HRMSY < 1$.
- *P(Orange)*, Probability of being in Kobe orange quadrant, $SB > SB_{MSY} \land HRMSY >= 1$.
- *P(Yellow)*, Probability of being in Kobe yellow quadrant, $SB <= SB_{MSY} \land HRMSY < 1$.
- *P(Red)*, Probability of being in Kobe red quadrant, $SB <= SB_{MSY} \land HRMSY >= 1$.
- *P(SB>=SB[MSY])*, Probability of SB greater or equal to SBMSY.
- *P(SB>SB[limit])*, Probability that spawner biomass is above 10% SB0.
- *C*, Total catch.
- *C/MSY*, Proportion of MSY.
- *AAV(C)*, Annual variability in catch.
- *IAC(C)*, Percentage inter-annual change in catch, $(C_{y-1} - C_{y}) / C_{y}$.
- *P(shutdown)*, Probability of fishery shutdown, taken to be when catch falls below 1% of MSY.
