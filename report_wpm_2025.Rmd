# Introduction

# Operating model update

- ABC OM, refer to WPM_2024

The original conditioning of the ABC operating models employed the datasets available at that time. These were assembled for the 2022 stock assessment of albacore tuna [@WPTmT_2022]. An updated catch and CPUE dataset is now available [@WPTmT_2025] that contains data up to 2023. A revision of past catch data has also taken place. The assessment results, in both cases for the NW-CPUE models, show differences in the estimated population trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:sas-compare)). Overall stock scale differs by 8% for both virgin SSB and recruitment.

```{r sas-compare, fig.cap="Time series of recruitment, SSB, catch and fishing mortality from the WPTmt 2022 and WPTmt 2025 SS3 base-case stock assessments."}

```

The OMs have now been updated for the new catch information, but no full reconditioning has been carried out. The OM was projected for the new nominal catch series between 2010 and 2023, with recruitment being predicted by the stock-recruit relationship, with standard lognormal deviances. The updated base case OM sjows a stock that has been overexploited in the recent past but has recovered in abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:oms-compare)).

```{r oms-compare, fig.cap="Total catch, relative harvest rate over that at MSY, recruitment, and SSB for the OM conditioned on the 2022 WPTmT dataset (COND), and that updated to the 2025 WPTmT dataset."}
knitr::include_graphics("report/data_oms_compare.png")
```

The index of abundance of the base case OM, the LL CPUE series in the NW area, has been recalculated given the updated abundances but using the original estimated selectivity and catchability. Figure \@ref(fig:ids-compare) present the two quarterly indices.

```

- SSB in updated OM matches better new SA
- REC differ as devianmces from SRR are modelled in different ways

```{r om-compare-sa, fig.cap="SSB and recruitment as output by the ABC base case operating model, with the superimposed trajectories from the WPTmT 2022 SS3 stock assessment (blue) and the WPTmT 2025 model (green)."}

```

- FWD(C=MSY) and FWD(C=0)

```{r om-fwd, fig.cap="Time series of catch, relative harvest rate, recruitment and SSB for two future projections of the base case OM: with no catch (C0) and for catch equal to the MSY estimated by the 2025 stock assessment model run (MSY)."}

## cpue.ind + bufferdelta.hcr

- TEST

- TUNING

# Next steps

- FINALIZE tuning model-free
- RUNS on robustness OMs
- ADD CC robustness, DEFINE w/WPTmT
- TEST under IEM
- OEM catch error, 20% - 30%
- RUN all for jabba.sa + bufferdelta.hcr(depletion)
- REPORT by start of DEC 2026
- CIRCULATE to interested parties
- PRESENT at WPM MSE FEB 2026
